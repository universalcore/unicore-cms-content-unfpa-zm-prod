  "content": "Most of your relationships are going to be healthy and fun ones. A healthy relationship is an equal one. An unhealthy relationship is not an equal one. \r\n\r\nHere are some signs of an unhealthy relationship:\r\n\r\n*Jealous and possessive*. They may accuse you of cheating or flirting without any reason, and are always suspicious of where you have been or who you\u2019ve been with.  \r\n*Controlling*. The person demands your time and attention, controls the finances and becomes angry if you show signs of independence.  \r\n*Always winning*. The person believes he or she is always right, and justifies his or her actions by blaming you or other people.  \r\n*Manipulative*. You're told you're crazy or stupid when you express yourself on certain points, and you are made to believe that things are your fault. They also play \u2018the silent game\u2019, ignore you or lock you out as punishment when they don\u2019t get their own way.  \r\n*Moody.* The person\u2019s moods swing from aggressive and abusive to apologetic and loving after the abuse has occurred.  \r\n*Contradictory*. The person breaks promises, says they love you and then turns on you.\r\n\r\n**He says:** \u201cShe\u2019s my girlfriend so if she says \u2018No\u2019 to sex she doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d\r\n**She says:** \u201cHe\u2019s crazy thinking he can walk around with another girl. I\u2019ll bet the slap I gave him taught him to respect me. I am nobody\u2019s fool!\u201d\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s true?**    \r\n\r\n * You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to, to prove you love\r\n   him.   \r\n * Forced sex between partners is rape.  \r\n * A \u2018firm slap\u2019 does not mean she loves you passionately, it is physical violence. \r\n\r\n**If your relationship does not make you feel safe, comfortable and good about yourself, it could be time to leave. Being safe and happy starts with you.** \r\n",
