  "content": "Rape is an attack and it can happen to a boy or a girl. But it doesn\u2019t always happen on a street or with a stranger. Most often a rapist is someone you know and trust. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is, rape is a violent crime. Your first goal is to get away from the rapist and get help. \r\n\r\n<ins>Here\u2019s how to stay safe: </ins>\r\n \r\n+ *Trust your gut*. If someone is making you feel awkward and nervous, get away from them. Make an excuse, leave the room, find a crowd, grab a friend or just run. \r\n+ *Stick to safe places*. Avoid being alone in dark places like empty streets, open lots or an empty house. If you feel that you\u2019re being followed, move quickly to where there are lots of people or even pretend to talk loudly on your phone or to yourself. \r\n+ *Watch what you drink.* Don\u2019t drink too much.  You could make bad decisions and get into situations where you are more vulnerable for a rape to happen. Do not leave your drink if you go to the bathroom, order another one. Someone can put drugs (called date rape drugs) into it so you can be confused and more vulnerable to rape\r\n+ *Be firm*. If someone is making you feel uneasy, tell them in a very firm, confident voice to leave you alone. It\u2019s important that they know you mean business. Look them in the eye. If you are in a vulnerable position try and sit up or stand up and face them squarely. \r\n+ *Make a big noise*. Whether it\u2019s happening in your house, a friend\u2019s house or a deserted place with a stranger, don\u2019t be silent. Scream to attract attention no matter who the rapist is.  Better still carry a whistle or pepper spray and use them!   \r\n+ *Have change.* Make sure you have always have enough money to get a cab / taxi if you find yourself in a potential rape situation.\r\n\r\n**Rape is a crime and it is never your fault. Your first goal is to survive the attack, or get away, and then get help.** ",
