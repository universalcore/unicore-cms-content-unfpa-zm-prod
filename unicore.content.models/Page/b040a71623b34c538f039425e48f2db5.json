  "content": "Rape is forcing somebody to have sex. This means forcing any body part, or any other object, into someone\u2019s vagina, anus or forcing a penis into somebody\u2019s mouth. It is a crime to have sex with somebody by force or without their consent (agreement). \r\n\r\nRape can happen to anyone at any time, and it can happen to both boys and girls. Having sex with someone who is passed out drunk or asleep is rape. Having sex with someone who can\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 is rape. Forcing sex onto your wife when she is tired, sick or not ready to have sex is also rape (marital rape).\r\n\r\nBeing raped is no small thing \u2013 it is seen as a violent crime. A rapist can be a stranger but most often it is actually someone you know \u2013 even a family member. This is just as scary as being assaulted by a stranger. It may even take a while for you to realise that what's happened to you is sexual assault or rape, and even then you still might have doubts because your attacker was someone you trusted. But if you didn\u2019t want it and they forced it \u2013 it is rape.\r\n\r\nOften a rape survivor keeps quiet and hides what happened. They feel ashamed or are scared they will be being blamed for what happened (blaming the victim)\r\n\r\n**You are never responsible for being raped . As a survivor you are responsible for what action you take after the rape. You can take PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) within 72 hours to prevent you from getting infected with HIV. Emergency contraceptives can prevent a pregnancy.**\r\n",
