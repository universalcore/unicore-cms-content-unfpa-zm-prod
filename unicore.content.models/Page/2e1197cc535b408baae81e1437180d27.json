Sometimes stories are made up and are not true. \r\n\r\n<ins>Here are some examples:</ins>\r\n\r\n**You heard:** Only girls get raped.  \r\n**The truth:** Boys can get raped too! \r\n\r\n**You heard:** It\u2019s not rape if it\u2019s your boyfriend or girlfriend.  \r\n**The truth:** Most rapes happen with someone you know. It is never anyone\u2019s right to rape you. \r\n\r\n**You heard:** But we had been together before.  \r\n**The truth:** You can say no, even if you have had sex with that person before. \r\n\r\n**You heard:** It\u2019s not fair if we were in middle of sex and she says no. That\u2019s not rape.  \r\n**The truth:** It can be difficult to stop when you are in the middle of things, but if your partner asks you to stop at any time always respect that request. If you force it, it\u2019s rape. \r\n\r\n**You heard:** She was asking for it (sex) wearing such short, sexy clothes.  \r\n**The truth:** Wearing sexy clothes does not mean a girl wants to have sex. Nor does kissing or flirting. \r\n\r\n**You heard:** It was sex, not rape.  \r\n**The truth:** If a boy forces himself on a girl after she has said no, or while she is passed out from drugs or alcohol, he is raping her, they are not having sex! The same applies if a girl forces a boy into sex. \r\n\r\n**You heard:** If they don\u2019t say no \u2013 it\u2019s still okay.  \r\n**The truth:** If you are trying to get sexual with someone and they are pushing you away, drunk, passed out or obviously not enjoying it, but you still carry on, it is rape. Just because they didn\u2019t say the word \u2018No!\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that they wanted to have sex.\r\n\r\n**You heard:** Some people lie about rape to explain why they are not virgins.  \r\n**The truth:** Many people tell lies, and not just about rape. If someone reports a rape, it\u2019s important to take it seriously and investigate it before assuming they are lying.",
