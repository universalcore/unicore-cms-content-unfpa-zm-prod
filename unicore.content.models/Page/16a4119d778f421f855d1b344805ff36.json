  "content": "During puberty you\u2019ll start to grow hair in all sorts of new places \u2013 on your face, around your mouth, on your chest, under your armpits and around your private parts (pubic hair). Your arm and leg hair will also get thicker and darker. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s normal to grow new hair and it\u2019s part of growing up. Girls like to remove the hair from their armpits, legs and sometimes around their mouths. It\u2019s okay for boys to keep the hair under their arms and on their legs but if you\u2019re still in school and you\u2019re growing a lot of facial hair, you\u2019ll probably need to start shaving. \r\n\r\n**How do I shave?** \r\nYou\u2019ll need to buy a good razor. Every morning when you wake up, rub your face with soap or shaving cream and glide the razor across your skin gently (so you don\u2019t cut yourself). You\u2019ll most likely need to shave every two or three days, depending on how thick and dark your hair is. Remember to keep your razor clean and don\u2019t share it with others as it spreads germs.\r\n\r\n**Your body is changing. Part of growing up is learning to take care of it without your parents nagging you. Choosing to be clean-shaven can show you care about the way you look. But it\u2019s also your choice to grow a fashion beard.**\r\n",
