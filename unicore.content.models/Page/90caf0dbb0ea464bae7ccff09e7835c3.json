  "content": "As your body develops during puberty, you\u2019ll start to think more about sex. When you have sexual feelings for someone, thinking about them or being around them will make you feel sexually excited. \r\n\r\nThese feelings are all part of growing up but it\u2019s how you deal with them that is important! \r\n\r\n**You want to have sex, but are you old enough?** \r\nIf you\u2019re under 16 it\u2019s illegal to have sex. This law is there to protect you. You might feel sexual about someone and your body will feel ready for sex, but your mind and emotions may not be ready. Sex comes with many grown-up responsibilities, like becoming a parent and dealing with possible sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \r\n\r\n**Is it really your choice right now?** \r\n\r\n - What are your values? \r\n - Is someone pressuring you, do you feel comfortable with this person? \r\n - Do you feel like you can say no or change your mind at any time?  \r\n - Do you think it\u2019s better to wait? \r\n - Are you pressuring someone else?\r\n - Are you old enough? \r\n - Do you know how to use contraception (condoms) to avoid pregnancy or disease? \r\n\r\n**Are you under pressure?**\r\nHaving sex with someone is not the only way to show that you love them. When you\u2019re old enough to have sex, it is still your right to decide if you want to or not. There are many other steps to dating that should come before sex, like kissing and holding hands. \r\nYou may also feel pressure from your friends who tell you that they\u2019re having sex (even if they aren\u2019t!).  It\u2019s tough to stand your ground, but it\u2019s important to care for yourself first.\r\n\r\n**Know your body rights: you choose when to have sex. Delay your first sexual encounter until you are sure you feel ready. Then, talk to a doctor, nurse or counsellor about using contraception to protect yourself against pregnancy, HIV and sexually transmitted infections. If you want to finish school or go to college one day, safe sex is important.** \r\n",
