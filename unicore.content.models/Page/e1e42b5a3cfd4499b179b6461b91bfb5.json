  "content": "From the day you\u2019re born, your body is growing and developing. When you reach about 10 years old your body starts to change in different ways, until you\u2019re about 15 or 16. These are your teenage years, also known as puberty or adolescence, when you change from a young boy into a man. \r\n\r\nYou start puberty about two years later than girls and you\u2019ll notice that you\u2019re growing taller, your voice is getting deeper, you\u2019re sweating more, your muscles are developing, you\u2019re getting pimples and you\u2019re growing hair everywhere! There\u2019s hair from your armpits to your chest, your face and around your private parts (pubic hair).\r\n\r\n**So what\u2019s causing all these changes?** \r\nYour body starts to produce new hormones (chemicals) when you hit puberty. The hormones are responsible for all your physical changes, but they\u2019re working on your emotions too. You may start to feel insecure, competitive, aggressive and be confused by your own emotions. It\u2019s your body\u2019s way of dealing with all the changes you\u2019re going through. Sometimes it\u2019s good to have an adult that you trust who you can talk to when you need to. \r\n\r\nYour body will also start to make sperm (this is what can make a girl pregnant). Sperm is in your semen \u2013 the white, sticky liquid that comes out your penis when you ejaculate. Sometimes you\u2019ll wake up with wet pants after having a wet dream (that\u2019s when you ejaculate while you\u2019re sleeping). This is part of your development and it\u2019s completely normal. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry if your muscles aren\u2019t growing or your voice isn\u2019t breaking yet, we all grow and develop at different stages, it will happen!   \r\n\r\n**Puberty can be a confusing and emotional time. There are no rules as to how your body will change into an adult. Don\u2019t compare yourself to your friends, it will all happen at the right time. Angry feelings and bad moods are normal - but keep them in check. You\u2019ll need your friends more than ever now!** \r\n",
