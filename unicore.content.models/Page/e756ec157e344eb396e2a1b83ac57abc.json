You feel safe.\r\n+ When you fight or argue, you resolve the argument without getting angry or hurting each other. \r\n+ Your boyfriend or girlfriend never asks you to choose between him/her and your loyalties to your family and friends.\r\n+ Neither of you feels the need to test each other's loyalties or feelings.\r\n+ If sex is part of your relationship, it is because you both want it and agree to it without pressure. \r\n+ When you have sex, you both enjoy it and it increases the feeling of emotional closeness and love between you. \r\n\r\n**It may take a few relationships before you find one that is working, healthy and happy. You may have to learn what to look out for in a boyfriend or girlfriend, and what you like and don\u2019t like. But it is worth waiting for a relationship that is based on love, respect and mutual protection.** \r\n",
