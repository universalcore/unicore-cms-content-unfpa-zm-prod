  "content": "In a good, loving relationship you will notice these things: \r\n\r\n+ You have strong caring feelings as well as physical attraction for your boyfriend or girlfriend, and you would easily agree that the word to describe this is \u201clove\u201d. \r\n+ You know that your boyfriend or girlfriend loves you because they have said \u201cI love you\u201d back.  \r\n+ Your boyfriend or girlfriend makes you feel special and good about yourself.\r\n+ You trust them not to betray you or hurt your relationship. You feel safe.\r\n+ When you fight or argue, you resolve the argument without getting angry or hurting each other. \r\n+ Your boyfriend or girlfriend never asks you to choose between him/her and your loyalties to your family and friends.\r\n+ Neither of you feels the need to test each other's loyalties or feelings.\r\n+ If sex is part of your relationship, it is because you both want it and agree to it without pressure. \r\n+ When you have sex, you both enjoy it and it increases the feeling of emotional closeness and love between you. \r\n\r\n**It may take a few relationships before you find one that is working, healthy and happy. You may have to learn what to look out for in a boyfriend or girlfriend, and what you like and don\u2019t like. But it is worth waiting for a relationship that is based on love, respect and mutual protection.** \r\n",
