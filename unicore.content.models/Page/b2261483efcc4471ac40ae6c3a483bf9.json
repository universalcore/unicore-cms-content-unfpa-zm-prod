  "content": "It\u2019s easy to look at celebrities in magazines and wish you looked more like them. But they are not real people - they are perfect people! Don\u2019t compare yourself to them.  You are beautiful in your own way and what makes you attractive to others is not just your body but all of you. \r\n\r\nYour basic body parts are here to stay. When you\u2019re born, you inherit some of your mom and your dad\u2019s features and your body grows to be like no other body! Maybe you\u2019re tall, have big hips, small breasts, ears that stick out or a funny nose. The most important thing to know is you are you - and that\u2019s what makes you beautiful. \r\n\r\nBody shape and looks are not the only things that make you beautiful \u2013 your personality and your self-esteem (how you feel about your body) play a big part too. \r\n\r\n**There are three types of basic body shapes. Can you spot yours?**\r\n\r\n 1. Endomorph: rounder curves with a bit of extra fat\r\n 2. Ectomorph: thin with less curves\r\n 3. Mesomorph: muscular with small hips and wide shoulders\r\n\r\n**No body shape is perfect. Everybody has something they don\u2019t like about themselves. It\u2019s learning to love what you\u2019ve got that is important. Instead of comparing how you look to others, rather celebrate the fact that you\u2019re in a healthy, strong body!** \r\n",
