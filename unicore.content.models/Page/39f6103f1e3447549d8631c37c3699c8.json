  "content": "Your period (menstrual cycle) is when you bleed from your vagina. It\u2019ll start when you hit puberty \u2013 some girls start sooner than others, but all girls get their period eventually. \r\n\r\nA period is nothing to be ashamed of. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re now a woman and can fall pregnant. \r\n\r\n**How it works\u2026**\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll get your period every 28 days or so and the menstrual cycle works the same every month. When you finish your period (it\u2019s usually about 5 days), the cycle starts at the beginning again, and this is how it goes\u2026  \r\n\r\n**DAYS 1 \u2013 5:** Your period.\r\n\r\n**DAYS 6 - 13:** Your period ends and your uterus (womb) prepares a lining (wall) and your ovaries start to ripen a new egg. \r\n\r\n**DAYS 14 \u2013 19:**  After a few days the egg will be ready and your ovaries will release it. It will move down your fallopian tubes towards your uterus (this is called ovulating). You have the highest chance of getting pregnant if you have sex during ovulation (Day 14) or the days before.  If you have unprotected sex, there is a chance that the boy/man\u2019s sperm will enters your vagina and makes the journey into the cervix, vagina, and fallopian tubes where the sperm hope to meet an egg. If they meet, the egg becomes fertilised in the fallopian tube, travels and attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. If you don\u2019t have sex or you use a condom, the egg will eventually start to break up. \r\n\r\n**DAYS 19 \u2013 28:** Your body will know once the egg has started to break and it will get rid of the lining in your uterus that it built up. \r\nDAY 1:  This the first day of your new monthly period. And the menstrual cycle starts all over again. \r\n\r\n**Your period starts now and will continue until your late 40s / early 50s and then you go through other changes called menopause. Understand how your body works  so you can protect yourself from an early or unintended pregnancy.**",
