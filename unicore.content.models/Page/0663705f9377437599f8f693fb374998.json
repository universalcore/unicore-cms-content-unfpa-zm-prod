There are different reasons for finding someone sexy \u2013 it could be because of their looks, their personality or even their money or job!.\r\n \r\nBut attraction (or lust) does not necessarily mean you love them. And because they desire you does not always mean they love you. Love is a very strong feeling towards another person and it\u2019s more than just attraction. \r\n\r\n**Here are a few tips to help you check if it\u2019s love or lust:**\r\n\r\n* Lust is instant \r\n* Love takes time to grow \r\n\r\n* Lust is when you\u2019re attracted to a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know very well, because it is purely physical.\r\n* Love involves someone whose strengths and weaknesses you know. You can\u2019t love someone you don\u2019t know!\r\n \r\n+ Lust is all about feelings and immediate emotions \r\n+ Love means both your heart and head are in control. \r\n \r\n+ Lust involves someone you think is perfect.\r\n+ Love means it may not be the perfect person but you appreciate their weaknesses. and strengths. \r\n \r\n+ Lust can end just as suddenly as it started.\r\n+ Love usually takes time to end.\r\n\r\n**When you are feeling attracted to someone, it\u2019s easy to think you are in love. But love is a deeper, longer process. You can also love a friend, and never have sex with that person.** \r\n",
