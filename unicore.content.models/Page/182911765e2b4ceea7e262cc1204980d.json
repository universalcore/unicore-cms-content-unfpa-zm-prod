  "content": "All your friends might be talking about having sex (even if they are not) and this can put a lot of pressure on you to do it too. But becoming a man does not happen when you lose your virginity. Nor does it happen by having sex with many girls. Self-control, self-respect and the choice to wait for the right moment to share with the right person - are all better measures of manly behaviour. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t feel embarrassed if you aren\u2019t having sex, because the pressure to lose your virginity or sleep around can be intense. The truth is, losing your virginity or sleeping with someone is a private choice and it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s business. \r\n\r\n**Why wait?**   \r\nThere are lots of reasons to wait, but here are two really good ones:\r\n\r\n+ You won\u2019t have to worry about whether you have made a girl pregnant \r\n+ You have less chance of catching a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or HIV\r\n\r\nSex is a big deal. It might not seem like that to some people, but it is and it comes with a lot of feelings and emotions that are easier to deal with when you are older. \r\n\r\nYou also need to know that a girl\u2019s virginity is very important to her. When she says \u2018no\u2019 to sex then you have to respect her and listen to what she is saying. \r\n\r\nGirls can get a reputation when they lose their virginity so be respectful. That is what makes you a man!  \r\n\r\n**Ignore what your friends say about sex. Choosing to wait or abstain is a good choice. It means staying safe from STIs and the risk of making a girl pregnant.** \r\n",
