You may be looking for love or friendship, but end up just having sex. They are not the same. It\u2019s useful to know the difference.\r\n\r\n**<ins>Love, sex and friendship: </ins>**\r\n\r\nWe all want respect, trust, honesty and understanding in our relationships.\r\nGood friends help you with your problems, introduce you to new ideas and share your dreams for the future.\r\nLove is about respect and caring for each other.\t\r\nYou can love your friends without having sex with them.\r\nSex is pleasurable on its own \u2013 but having it with a friend can change your friendship.  You could even lose your friendship.\r\nYou can have fun, safe sex with people you are attracted to, without loving them. In this case, there is no love and no emotional connection which is the strongest feeling that makes love much more meaningful.\r\nMost people agree that the best sex is with someone you love and trust \u2013 and who loves you back. This is a relationship. \r\nLove never means putting a relationship before your personal well-being or doing things that make you feel unhappy. \r\nLoving someone also means protecting them at all times \u2013 from pregnancy, HIV, and abuse.\r\nThe best relationship is one where two people love each other, care for each other, respect each other and protect each other!\r\n\r\n**There are lots of ways to be with a person of the opposite sex and have a great relationship with them - without having sex!  If you are looking for closeness, look for friendships.** ",
