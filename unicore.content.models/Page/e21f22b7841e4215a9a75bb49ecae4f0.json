It\u2019s often hard to hide when you\u2019re sweating and it will feel like you\u2019re sweating everywhere \u2013 under your arms, in the palms of your hands, under your feet, on your face and even between your legs! \r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re playing sport or the weather is very hot, you\u2019ll obviously sweat more. But you\u2019ll also sweat when you\u2019re feeling excited or scared about something. Believe it or not, sweating actually helps you to cool down! \r\n\r\nMost sweat doesn\u2019t smell bad, but it can mix with the bacteria on your skin and that can make a bad smell. That\u2019s why it is important to stay clean. Make sure you wash with warm water and soap every day, especially around the places you sweat the most. Keep your clothes clean and washed. Use some underarm deodorant.  \r\n\r\n**Your body is changing. Part of growing up is learning to take care of it without your parents nagging you. Taking care of yourself will make you feel good about yourself. You deserve it!** \r\n",
