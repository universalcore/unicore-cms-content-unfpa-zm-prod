  "content": "Having a baby demands a lot of responsibility, from the moment you fall pregnant! If you are young and your body is still developing, growing a baby inside your body may cause some health problems for both you and your baby. It is best for a girl\u2019s body to be fully developed before she falls pregnant. \r\n\r\n**What could go wrong?** \r\nIf you fall pregnant when you\u2019re still going through puberty, you or your baby could suffer from: \r\n\r\n - Anaemia (extreme tiredness) \r\n - Hypertension (very stressed) \r\n - Weight loss\r\n - Premature birth / stillbirth (when your baby is born too early or not alive) \r\n\r\n**Babies are forever** \r\nYou will have a lot to think about for your baby\u2019s future, as well as your own.\r\nHave you thought about\u2026 \r\n\r\n - Whether your boyfriend, husband or family will be able to support you \r\n - The costs of having a baby and raising a child \r\n - How you\u2019re going to finish school\r\n - Who will look after your baby if you need to get a job\r\n - What it means to be a mom \r\n\r\n**Having a baby is for life. Girls who finish school first get further in life. They are more likely to get the skills to support themselves and their whole family. Make sure that when you have a baby, you are ready to have one!** ",
