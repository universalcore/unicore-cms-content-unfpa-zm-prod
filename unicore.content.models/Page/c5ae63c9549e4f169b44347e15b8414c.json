It is a gentle contraction of the muscles around your sex organs that feels great!\r\n\r\n**How can I have an orgasm?** \r\nWhen you touch or rub your vagina in a way that feels pleasurable, this is called masturbating. It can give you an orgasm (which is also called \u2018coming\u2019). It\u2019s safe and normal to masturbate but it should always be done alone and in private.

It\u2019s always up to you to decide who else touches your genitals, but you should always feel safe and** \r\n",
