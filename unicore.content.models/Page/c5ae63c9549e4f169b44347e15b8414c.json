It is a gentle contraction of the muscles around your sex organs that feels great!\r\n\r\n**How can I have an orgasm?** \r\nWhen you touch or rub your vagina in a way that feels pleasurable, this is called masturbating. It can give you an orgasm (which is also called \u2018coming\u2019). It\u2019s safe and normal to masturbate but it should always be done alone and in private.

When you hit the peak of your sexual excitement (climax) your muscles will contract and the feeling will spread. \r\n\r\n**How will I know if I\u2019ve had an orgasm?** \r\nMost people agree that it\u2019s a very nice feeling \u2013 like waves of pleasure going through your whole body. It is not something that sneaks up on you, generally you have to masturbate for a while to get there so you\u2019ll definitely know once you\u2019ve had an orgasm! \r\n\r\n**Masturbation is a safe way to learn about your own body and what feels good. It\u2019s always up to you to decide who else touches your genitals, but you should always feel safe and** \r\n",
