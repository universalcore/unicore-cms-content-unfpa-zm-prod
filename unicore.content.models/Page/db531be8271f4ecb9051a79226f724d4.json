Depression is a medical term to describe a constant feeling of sadness and lack of interest. Moodiness tends to come and go. \r\n\r\nYou can feel depressed even if everything seems to be going your way. Maybe you are alone and have no choice in this, or you don\u2019t feel part of a group or event, or you just don\u2019t have anyone who understands you.\r\n\r\nYou may feel:\r\n\r\n - unloved, unwanted, sad or hopeless\r\n - convinced that there is something wrong with you\r\n - like you want to withdraw from your family and friends\r\n - angry and critical of others\r\n - like crying for no reason\r\n - thoughts of death or suicide\r\n\r\nThe problem with depression is that it can lead to bad or destructive behaviour. You may use drugs or alcohol just to feel better, or you may have unsafe sex ending up in unplanned pregnancy or HIV or other STIs. You may even feel as if you hate yourself or want to hurt yourself. \r\n\r\n**Depression is a serious condition. It\u2019s also, unfortunately, a common one. You will find there is a way to get through it and feel better.** \r\n",
